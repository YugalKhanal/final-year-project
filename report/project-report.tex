\begin{abstract}
	% Briefly summarize the project, objectives, methods, and outcomes (100-300 words).
	% This section should highlight the main points of the report, including the purpose of the project, the approach taken, and the key results achieved.
	This project aims to develop a decentralised peer-to-peer file sharing system with robustness, fault tolerance, stability, reliability and data security. The primary objective of this project is to build a scalable and secure P2P network that allows users to upload, distribute, and download files efficiently across multiple nodes. The system implements both an HTTP server, which provides a user-friendly interface for file uploads, and a TCP server, which handles the data transfer between peers in the network.

	This approach minimizes dependence on any single point of control, improving the system’s resilience and fault tolerance.

	\vspace{3.5mm}Key features include file upload handling via a web interface, seamless peer communication using TCP connections, and efficient file distribution protocols. The system addresses significant challenges in network programming, data integrity, and fault tolerance to ensure that file transfers are both reliable and secure. Additional modules manage directory structures and ensure the smooth operation of file I/O processes. The project emphasizes modularity, making it possible to extend functionality to incorporate more advanced P2P techniques such as file indexing and peer discovery in the future. This report documents the design, development, and testing of the P2P File Sharing System, demonstrating its potential as a robust and scalable solution for decentralized file distribution.
