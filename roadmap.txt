I'll help you create a comprehensive structure for your 10,000-word dissertation based on your P2P file sharing implementation. After analyzing your code, I can see you've implemented several sophisticated features including:

Tracker-based peer discovery
Chunked file transfer with verification
Distributed file storage
UPnP port mapping
Fault-tolerant file transfers
Concurrent downloads with piece management
Heartbeat mechanism for peer health checks
Metadata management and verification

Key Areas to Focus On:

Your chunking implementation with verification:

goCopy// From piece_verification.go
func generateFileHashes(filePath string, chunkSize int) ([]string, string, int64, error) {
    // This shows sophisticated handling of file integrity
}

Your piece management system:

goCopy// From piece_manager.go
type PieceManager struct {
    pieces    map[int]*PieceInfo
    numPieces int
    mu        sync.RWMutex
}

Your tracker implementation:

goCopy// From tracker.go
type Tracker struct {
    fileIndex    map[string]*FileInfo
    peerIndex    map[string]map[string]bool
    peerLastSeen map[string]time.Time
    mu           sync.RWMutex
}
